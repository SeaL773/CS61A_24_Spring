# CS61A_24_Spring
This repository contains my personal solutions for the labs and problem sets from University of California, Berkeley CS61A course.

# Content
The repository is organized by week (problem sets) and labs. Each problem set and lab solution is contained in its own directory.

Please note that this content is meant for educational purposes and reference. If you're currently enrolled in the course, I highly encourage you to try and solve the problem sets yourself before referring to these solutions.

Please remember that ok can be run locally.

My answers will be more on the side of intuition, clarity, rather than efficiency, sophistication.

Feel free to ask me any questions, it helps us get better together!
